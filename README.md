-Update Dec 7th 2024:
version 0.0.8 released! I already added 5 more levels for a total of 15. Also started experimenting with basic music and sound, will be spending a lot of time on that next week!
Tommorrow I'll be working on a weekly devlog video and try to have it done by the end of day.

Dec 6th - version 0.0.7 - Major update, everything seems to be running much smoother now and you should be able to get through all 10 levels without getting super stuck.  If you do however, you can always use the "R" shortcut key to Restart the level at any time.  I updated the particle systems so its much more satisfying to break the blocks now!
- Have fun and please report any bugs you find! 

Much much more to come soon, I'll be working on this full time until its complete!

P.S. Level 10 can be difficult but is very finishable, I spent of lot of time working on it today to get it right.

I'll try to post update videos on or around every Sunday.

The game is still very much in development, has only 15 levels (out of 100 planned) and needs more sounds, music, 3D background, a very long list, but you can kind of get the gist of where I'm going with it.  It reminds me of a cross between breakout and pinball, for those of you old enough to remember pinball. 

For keyboard shortcuts and instructions check left column of the game.  I'll plan on making explanations for all the power-ups on the startup screen soon, but they're not too hard to figure out. 

TODO List:

Short Term
- Add more stages as time permits
- Add custom music and sounds for stages, menus, wherever it seems to fit and feel right.
- Start studying basic shaders
- Start experimenting with custom animations

Long Term 
- Create a clone of all 50 original levels from Block 1.30 (10 done)
- Add 50 new unique levels
- Create original sounds, music, themes and customization features
- Create teaching videos on modding the game and Godot tips / short tutorials

=========================================================

This is a game project I've been wanting to work on for a very long time. Now that the years have flown by, and the original game that inspired me to re-create it has fallen into obscurity, (among other reasons), the time is now!

The original inspiration for this project came from a game I found many years ago (over 20) called "Block", programmed by a Japanese developer that went by the name of "Kenta".  It's basically a Breakout / Arkanoid clone but with a TON of FUN features!

I recently dug up the original game on "Wayback Machine" and tried to play it on my modern system but no dice!  Luckily and thankfully with the help of programming genius Nathan Baggs the game is now playable again, and now I can study its ways and try to somewhat faithfully re-create its magic.

This repository will serve as both a learning hub for those who wish to get a closer look at how I'm accomplishing this task, and as a way to check on my progress.

At the current stage I'm using the Godot engine, and I'm in the process of learning its intricacies. 

Here are some links to the various people / places I mentioned:

My plan is to create progress reports and / or video every Sunday.

The game will be eventually released for free on itch.io and maybe other platforms depending on how well everything goes.

Instructions :

Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/chaduke/paddles_balls_blocks_walls```

Open the project in Godot 4.3
