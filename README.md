-Update Dec 4th 2024:

Hosting the web version now on itch.io and its working great.  I also ironed out many of the bugs I was dealing with the web version and new menus.  Now I'm ready to fill out the rest of the core features and test gameplay, the hopefully on to adding the rest of the levels!	
version 0.0.5 - fixed a bug making level 6 impossible to finish 

Watch the intro video here :

I'll try to post update videos on or around every Sunday.  

Play the web version here (it is improving quickly but still expect bugs):

The game is still very much in development, has only 10 levels and needs a lot of tweaking here and there plus sounds, music, more 3D stuff, a very long list, but you can kind of get the gist of where I'm going with it.  It reminds me of a cross between breakout and pinball, for those of you old enough to remember pinball. 

To play just use the mouse to move the paddle, left click "swings" the paddle and right click releases balls. Enjoy!

TODO List:

Short Term
- Get core functionality complete and working
- Keep track of player's best times 
- Find out why the ball lands on the paddle sometimes and stops
- Find out why some cracked yellow blocks remain on level completion 
- Make particles look more realistic

Long Term 
- Create a clone of all 50 original levels from Block 1.30 (10 done)
- Add 50 new unique levels
- Redo all sounds / music in Ableton Live

=========================================================

This is a game project I've been wanting to work on for a very long time. Now that the years have flown by, and the original game that inspired me to re-create it has fallen into obscurity, (among other reasons), the time is now!

The original inspiration for this project came from a game I found many years ago (20 maybe?) called "Block", programmed by a Japanese developer that went by the name of "Kenta".  It's basically a Breakout / Arkanoid clone but with a TON of FUN features!

I recently dug up the original game on "Wayback Machine" and tried to play it on my modern system but no dice!  Luckily and thankfully with the help of programming genius Nathan Baggs the game is now playable again, and now I can study its ways and try to somewhat faithfully re-create its magic.

This repository will serve as both a learning hub for those who wish to get a closer look at how I'm accomplishing this task, and as a way to check on my progress.

At the current stage I'm using the Godot engine, and I'm in the process of learning its intricacies. 

Here are some links to the various people / places I mentioned:

My plan is to create progress reports and / or video every Sunday.

The game will be eventually released for free on itch.io and maybe other platforms depending on how well everything goes.

Instructions :

Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/chaduke/paddles_balls_blocks_walls```

Open the project in Godot 4.3
