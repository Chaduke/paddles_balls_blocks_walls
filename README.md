This is a game project I've been wanting to work on for a very long time. Now that the years have flown by, and the original game that inspired me to re-create it has fallen into obscurity, (among other reasons), the time is now!

The original inspiration for this project came from a game I found many years ago (20 maybe?) called "Block", programmed by a Japanese developer that went by the name of "Kenta".  It's basically a Breakout / Arkanoid clone but with a TON of FUN features!

I recently dug up the original game on "Wayback Machine" and tried to play it on my modern system but no dice!  Luckily and thankfully with the help of programming genius Nathan Baggs the game is now playable again, and now I can study its ways and try to somewhat faithfully re-create its magic.

This repository will serve as both a learning hub for those who wish to get a closer look at how I'm accomplishing this task, and as a way to check on my progress.

At the current stage I'm using the Godot engine, and I'm in the process of learning its intracacies. 

Here are some links to the various people / places I mentioned:

TODO List:

- Create a clone of all 50 original levels from Block 1.30
- Add 50 new unique levels
- Create a Menu
- Create a UI / HUD
- Redo all sounds / music in Ableton Live

My plan is to create progress reports and / or video every Sunday.

The game will be eventually released for free on itch.io and maybe other platforms depending on how well everything goes.

Instructions :

Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/chaduke/paddles_balls_blocks_walls```

Open the project in Godot 4.3
