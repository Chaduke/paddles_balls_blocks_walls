# Godot Scene Node Hierarchy

**Main** - The main scene serves a code entry point (after autoloaded scenes and scripts), but mainly as a container for all other scenes that make up the game.
**Stage** - Child of Main.  Contains the wall meshes and their collision shapes, the spare balls display, labels indicating stage number, current times, items, score, blocks left, best stage time, best total time,  a timer to display "Ready Set Go!", and an AudioStreamPlayer.  This scene should be loaded dynamically after the interaction with the main menu at the beginning of the game.  At the start of each new stage, blocks from the "stage_blocks" folder, which  correspond with the upcoming stage, should be instantiated and added as a child of stage.  This scene should either check for, or cooperate in stage completion or game over events.  At these events the stage needs to be cleared of all blocks, pickup items, and anything else that doesn't need to be active at that time.  The proper labels or menus need to be displayed to shows stats and provide a way to move to the next game state.
