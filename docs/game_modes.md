# Game Modes

PBBW currently supports two game modes, Timed and Arcade.

## Timed Game Mode

In "Timed" game mode, the player gets 10 spare balls at the beginning of every stage.  The player has the option to release as many of these spare balls as desired during the course of the stage, either by right-clicking or using the Ball Gun (keyboard shortcut G). The focus is on completing stages as fast as possible.  If the player loses all 10 balls before completing the stage, the stage can be restarted.  At the completion of each stage, the game checks to see if the player's previous record time has been beaten, and if so reports it.  It also checks "total record time" which represents the total accumulated time of completing all the stages up to and including the last completed stage.  If this record time has been beaten the game also reports it.

## Arcade Game Mode

In "Arcade" game mode, the player gets 3 balls at the beginning of the first stage. The player may only release one ball at a time.  When blocks are destroyed in this mode, score is accumulated.  Every 10,000 points the player receives an extra spare ball. When all three balls are lost the game ends.  The player can restart the stage but only gets the number of balls and score that was present at the start of the stage.  This game mode should encourage the player to think somewhat more strategically about how to approach completing each stage, and spend more time learning how to control the ball with good paddle positioning.
